# Project Log: Futuro Digital Website

**Date:** 2024-10-29

## 1. Session Summary & Goal

Today's session focused on a significant strategic enhancement: transforming a course-specific slide deck into a universal, high-value learning resource for all users. The primary goal was to create a foundational guide on digital teamwork and integrate it seamlessly into the user journey of every course.

## 2. Key Features Implemented

### 2.1. Creation of the "Trabalhar em Equipa" Transversal Guide
*   **Action:** The `wordloop-slides.html` page was repurposed from a specific course resource into a generic, introductory guide titled "Trabalhar em Equipa na CMLisboa - primeiros passos".
*   **Impact:** This creates a single, reusable asset that provides a consistent knowledge baseline for all learners, regardless of which course they are taking. It adds significant value and efficiency to the learning program.

### 2.2. Iterative Design of the "Invitation" Component (`.transversal-resource-cta`)
This component was built and refined through a highly effective iterative process based on direct user feedback.
*   **Version 1 (Initial Concept):** A new section was added to all four course pages, inviting users to view the guide.
*   **Version 2 (Visual Enhancement):** The section was redesigned into a full-width, visually impactful banner with a background image, based on a user-provided mock-up.
*   **Version 3 (Dynamic Polish):** The design was further evolved to feature a separate, animated image that "floated" above the section to grab attention.
*   **Version 4 (Final Refinement):** Based on usability feedback, the floating image was resized to be smaller and repositioned cleanly above the text to ensure perfect readability and a balanced layout.

## 3. Lessons Learned & Design Principles Reinforced

*   **Content Strategy: Create Once, Use Everywhere.** The decision to create a transversal guide is a powerful content strategy. It's more efficient to maintain one high-quality introductory resource than four separate ones, and it ensures a standardized learning experience.
*   **Iterative Design is Our Best Workflow:** The evolution of the invitation section proves that our most successful pattern is to build a functional version, review it visually, gather feedback, and then refine it. This collaborative loop leads to a superior final product that perfectly matches the user's vision.
*   **UI/UX Details Matter:** The feedback to fix the image overlapping the text highlights a core principle: a clean, readable, and polished user interface is a top priority. Small adjustments to spacing, size, and layout have a large impact on the perceived quality and professionalism of the design.
*   **The Power of Component-Based CSS:** Our organized CSS file made it trivial to create, style, and then completely redesign the `.transversal-resource-cta` component and have those changes instantly and consistently reflected across all four course pages. This validates our decision to invest in a structured stylesheet.
