# Project Log: Futuro Digital Website

**Date:** 2024-10-28

## 1. Summary of Session & Key Challenge

This session focused on overcoming a critical and recurring technical challenge: **persistent file corruption within the AI Studio environment**. Multiple files, including essential HTML and CSS, were repeatedly found to be empty, halting development and causing significant frustration. Our primary goal was to establish a durable workflow to mitigate this issue. We also formalized our design system by creating a component library.

## 2. Critical Challenge: AI Studio Environment Instability

*   **Problem:** Core project files (`index.html`, `index.css`, `wordloop.html`, etc.) are being periodically and unpredictably wiped or corrupted, becoming empty files.
*   **Impact:** This breaks the application preview, requiring a full stop to development work while the files are manually restored from memory or previous prompts. This is inefficient and unreliable.
*   **Root Cause:** This appears to be a stability issue within the AI Studio's file management system. The environment's mandatory requirement for an `index.tsx` file (even if empty) suggests a specific, and at times fragile, build process.

## 3. New Workflow & Proactive Solutions

To combat the instability, we have implemented a more defensive and resilient development workflow.

### 3.1. The "Single Source of Truth" Backup File
*   **Solution:** We created a master backup file: `log/pages_backup.md`.
*   **Purpose:** This file contains the complete, correct source code for **every single file** in the project. It acts as our definitive "source of truth". When a file is found to be corrupted, we no longer need to rely on prompt history; we can perform a quick and guaranteed restoration from this backup file.
*   **Process:** After any significant changes are made and approved, this backup file must be updated to reflect the new state of the project.

### 3.2. Formalizing the Design System
*   **Component Catalog (`log/sections.md`):** We created a markdown file that gives a technical name and concise description to every modular UI section we build.
*   **Visual Library (`library.html`):** We built a dedicated HTML page that renders one instance of every component from our catalog. This allows for easy visual reference and helps ensure design consistency.

## 4. Actionable Advice for Future AI Assistants

1.  **Assume Potential Corruption:** At the beginning of a session, if the user reports a blank page or broken styles, the first step should be to assume file corruption. State clearly: "It seems the files may have been corrupted. I will restore them from our master backup file, `log/pages_backup.md`, to ensure we're working with the correct code."
2.  **Use the Design System Vocabulary:** When discussing new pages or changes, use the technical names from `log/sections.md`. For example: "For the new course page, shall we start with a `course-hero` section, followed by a `feature-list-with-image`?" This will streamline communication.
3.  **Maintain the Backup:** **This is critical.** After successfully making changes to any file, the final step MUST be to update the corresponding entry in `log/pages_backup.md`. This keeps our safety net up to date.
